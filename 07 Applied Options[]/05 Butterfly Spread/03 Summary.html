	From the following algorithm, at time 0, the GOOG share price is $832.8. We purchase 1 OTM call option strike at $855, 1 ITM call option strike at $810 and sell 2 ATM options strike at 835. At the expiry 05/19/2017, the share price is $930, then the long positions of the ITM option and the OTM option are all exercised, we buy 100 GOOG  shares at $810 and buy another 100 shares at $855. At the same time, the 2 short positions of the ATM option are also exercised. We have to sell 200  GOOG shares to option holder at $835. Then we no longer hold positions after the expiration of this Long Call Butterfly Spread. Since the stock price had a sharp increase during the life of options, we make no profits from this strategy.
