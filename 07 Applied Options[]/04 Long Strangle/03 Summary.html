	You can enter into Long Strangle if you have no clear idea of market direction but forecast there will be a great movement in the underlying asset. As the options you buy are all out of the money, that reduces the cost of this strategy. ButÂ because the call and the put options are all out of the money, the stock will need to move even more significantly than long straddle to gain positive profit from this strategy.
