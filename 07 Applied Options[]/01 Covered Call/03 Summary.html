<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  From the above strategy we can see, Â the share price of IBM had been increasing during the backtesting period from January 2016 to June 2016. The drawdown is small. The Covered Call strategy performs better than a simple buy-and-hold strategy of underlying stock in a bearish market. The benefit of Covered Call is that you keep the premium, stock gains up to the strike price, and accrued dividends during the stock holding period. But in a bullish market, you will lose the potential gains over the strike price.
