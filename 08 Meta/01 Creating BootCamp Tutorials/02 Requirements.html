Ensuring high-quality writing in BootCamp lessons is important to maintain the interest and motivation of the community. The skills required to build a BootCamp lesson cover several areas of expertise:
</p>
<ol>
<li>QuantConnect API: Contributors must have knowledge of the QuantConnect API along with the correct way to implement the desired behavior.</li>
<li>Programming Polygot: BootCamp algorithms are provided in both C# and Python. The text documentation is written in HTML, and the task validation code is performed in JavaScript. You should be able to code neatly in all four languages.</li>
<li>Principles of Algorithmic Trading: Domain expertise in finance is important to be able to build thoughtful and educational content.</li>
</ol> 
<p>
We highly recommended working closely with the QuantConnect team as you design and code the BootCamp lessons to get continuous feedback to ensure its deployed.
