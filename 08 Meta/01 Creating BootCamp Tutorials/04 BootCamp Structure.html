BootCamp is divided into <i>Courses</i>, <i>Lessons</i>, and <i>Tasks</i>.  A <i>Course</i> groups together a super-category and is currently organized by asset-class. A <i>Lesson</i> focuses on the implementation of a single algorithm.   A <i>Task</i> breaks up the algorithm implementation into tiny steps which can each be easily coded, with the aim of guiding the user through each layer of the algorithm design.

<p>The central guiding principle of BootCamp lessons is they are focused on the implementation of a single algorithmic trading strategy. </p>

      </li></ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>A lesson should be comprised of about 6-12 tasks, each building upon the lessons learned from the previous task. We have built a system for the community to design and submit BootCamp Lessons and Tasks. If you think your content requires another <i>Course</i> please let us know and we'll create one for you.
