<p>
BootCamp is divided into <i>Courses</i>, <i>Lessons</i>, and <i>Tasks</i>.  A <i>Course</i> groups together a super-category and is currently organized by asset-class. A <i>Lesson</i> focuses on the implementation of a single algorithm.   A <i>Task</i> breaks up the algorithm implementation into tiny steps which can each be easily coded, with the aim of guiding the user through each layer of the algorithm design. 
</p>


<h4>Core Principle</h4>
<p>The central guiding principle of BootCamp lessons is they are focused on the implementation of a single algorithmic trading strategy. At each level of the system, the titles should be directly related to the implementation of the strategy, not the concepts it is covering.</p>

<ul class="nested-list">
   <li>Course: Algorithmic Trading with Equities
      <ul><li>Lesson: Buy and Hold Algorithm 
         <ul><li>Task: Setting Cash</il></ul> 
      </li></ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
A lesson should be comprised of about 6-12 tasks, where each task builds upon the lessons learned from the previous task. We have built a system for the community to design and submit BootCamp Lessons and Tasks. If you think your content requires another <i>Course</i> please let us know and we'll create one for you.

<h4>Course</h4>
<p>
A course is a collection of <i>Lessons</i> in a similar difficulty class, relating to a similar topic. The table below shows the <i>Courses</i> QuantConnect is hoping to create over 2019.
