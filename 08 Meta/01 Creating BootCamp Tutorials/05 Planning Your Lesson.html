  Implement algorithm,
  Simplify as much as possible,
  break into concepts for implementation,
  draft bullets for each concept, 
  split into tasks which can be accomplished with 1-2 lines of code,
  include snippets of code and documentation needed to achieve the task - similar but not identical to the answer,
  
  Task structure,
