Carefully planning and structuring your lesson is critical to ensuring its success. In the next section, we'll create this plan step by step.

<h4>1. Strategy Selection and Implementation</h4>
<p>
Every BootCamp lesson is focused on an algorithmic strategy's implementation. The first step to planning a lesson is choosing a strategy which does not overlap with any of the existing BootCamp topics. This can be incrementally more difficult but should introduce new concepts.
</p>

<p>
After selecting your strategy you need to fully implement the algorithm, writing the code in C# and Python as simply as possible. Users new to coding have a hard time deciphering large blocks of code so strategies should be kept very simple.
</p>

<p>In writing the strategy remain aware of the conceptual layers you put into the algorithm's codebase. These layers of concepts are where you can separate out the lesson tasks. For example: in writing a lesson <i>"Buy and Hold, with Trailing Stop"</i> you might start by coding up the buy and hold logic, followed by placing a "trailing stop" (Stop Market Order, then finally you can make the algorithm stop move by updating the stop price.</p>


<p>
  Implement algorithm,
  Simplify as much as possible,
  break into concepts for implementation,
  draft bullets for each concept, 
  split into tasks which can be accomplished with 1-2 lines of code,
  include snippets of code and documentation needed to achieve the task - similar but not identical to the answer,
  
  Task structure,
