The LEAN Report Creator is a report generated from backtesting-result objects and allows you to quickly create polished, professional-grade reports for each backtest (see a full <a href="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/blog/20180615-backtest-report.html">example report</a> generated by LRC). Our hope is that you can use these reports to share your strategy performance with prospective investors.

Users working through the QuantConnect.com IDE can have these reports generated automatically at the end of a backtest. To generate one, look at the “Report” tab below your backtest result charts.
