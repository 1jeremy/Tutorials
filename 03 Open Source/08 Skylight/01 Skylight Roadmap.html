<h4>Skylight V0.1: File Synchronize</h4>
<p>
After logging into your account, Skylight synchronizes projects between the cloud and your local machine every minute. Every modification on either end, including creating, modifying, and deleting would sync automatically to the other end. Skylight is intended to be the foundation for QuantConnect to deploy additional features such as desktop charting and remote algorithm monitoring. 

Skylight updates automatically, checking our servers for the latest features and fixes. Once it finds a new update, Skylight downloads it silently in the background and installs it after you close the application.
