<p>Unfortunately, this debugging scenario entails some limitations.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to concurrently debug the python algorithm and Lean (C# code). That means that the debugger will not stop at breakpoints in Lean nor we can step into methods defined in Lean (e.g., SetHoldings).
</p>
<p>
Debugging the same method is not smooth since we need to detach and reattach the process every time we leave the method we are debugging.

  <li>Detach Lean by clicking on Debug -&gt; Detach All</li>
  <li>Reattach Lean by clicking on Debug -&gt; Reattach to Process</li>
  </ul>
