In this tutorial, we have learned how to debug python algorithms in Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
The process is not as smooth as debugging pure python or C# code and have some limitations.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, knowing how to debug python algorithms in Lean can give you a new level of understanding of their functionality and allow for easier implementation of the refined code in the IDE.
