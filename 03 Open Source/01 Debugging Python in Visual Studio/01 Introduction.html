    We often want to use an IDE for algorithm development because it provides comprehensive facilities such as a source code editor and a debugger. QuantConnect delivers a robust online source code editor, but not a debugger. For some algorithm developers, a debugger is an essential tool; therefore they opt to work offline with full-featured IDE.

    Visual Studio is a full-featured IDE that makes debugging<span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 14px; text-align: start;">&nbsp;</span>easy. Unlike other solutions that only allows debugging a single process/language, we can use it to debug a python algorithm in Lean (C# engine).

    In this tutorial, we'll show you how to debug your algorithm in LEAN from Visual Studio.
