  In this tutorial we will take a close look at a principal component analysis (PCA)-based statistical arbitrage strategy
  derived from the paper <a target=_BLANK href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071108.pdf">
  Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Market</a>.

  Statistical arbitrage strategies uses mean version models to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies between groups of correlated 
  securities. This class of short-term financial trading strategies produce moves contrarian with the market and are often referenced with

  In our algorithm, we will be using a PCA-based approach as opposed to an ETF-based approach to limit our universe of stocks. 
  Backtests from the period of 1997-2007 support our strategy by showing PCA-based strategies have Sharpe ratios that outperform ratios 
  from ETF-based strategies.
