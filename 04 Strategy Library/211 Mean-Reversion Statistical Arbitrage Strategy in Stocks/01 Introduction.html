  In this tutorial, we will take a close look at a principal component analysis (PCA)-based statistical arbitrage strategy
  based on the paper <a target=_BLANK href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071108.pdf">
  Statistical Arbitrage in teh U.S. Equities Market</a>.
</p>
<p> 
  First, we will apply PCA to minimizes our algorithm's exposure to market factors and project the first n (n=3 in our algorithm) 
  orthogonal principal components on our asset universe. Then we will model the mean-reverting residuals of our assets. 
  Next we will create our model using linear regression. Each factor will have a weight or coefficient equal to the residuals' level 
  of deviation from the mean.
