  In this tutorial, we will study the model-driven statistical arbitrage strategies in U.S. stocks market. We employ a combination of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression to implement this strategy. First, by applying PCA, we get a generalized statistical arbitrage strategy that minimizes exposure to market factors and the asset universe is projected onto its first n (n=3 in our algorithm) orthogonal principal components. Secondly, we model the mean-reverting residuals of the cluster of assets and get their weights based on the level of deviation using linear regression.
