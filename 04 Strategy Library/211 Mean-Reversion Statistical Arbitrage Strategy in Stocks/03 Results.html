    In our alorithm, the portfolio is rebalanced every 30 days and the backtest period runs from Jan 2010 to Aug 2019. 
    We can see from the results that it achieves an annual rate of return over 7% with a max drawdown of around 40% for nearly 10 years.
    The performance is generally good, which indicates using PCA combined with linear regression to measure the deviation level is 
    reasonable.

    To tune the model, we could expand the original coarse-selected universe. The current universe contains 20 equities, and sometimes the 
    algorithm only find one or even no candidate, which might be not enough. You might increase the number of universe. Besides, we can 
    develop this strategy to a long & short one (now it is only a long strategy). You could also come up with another way to measure the 
    level of deviation or change the rebalance frequency of the algorithm(30 days in this example). We sincerely hope you create more 
    amazing algorithms upon this tutorial.
