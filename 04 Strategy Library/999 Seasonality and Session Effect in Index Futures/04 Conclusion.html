For Night Session Strategy, both in the Bullish Season and the Bearish Season, the Night Session effect (well trading performance if buy at its open and sell at its end) for E-mini S&P 500 futures exists based on an 8-year long backtest. Particularly, on the bearish Season, we gain a 13%  return only with 5% maximum drawdown. 

For the Combined Strategy, its performance is not good, which is not consistent with the two articles on Seasonality and Market Session Effect. The reason is in the Afternoon Session and Close Session, the return is not as high as expected, and hence the Combined Strategy underperforms compared to the Night Session-only strategy.

For further study, we could consider a more delicate rule for stop loss/profit instead of just trading at a specific time on every trading day.
