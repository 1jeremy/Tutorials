	As can be seen in the backtest results, trading just during the Night Session, in both market seasons, performs well over an extended period. This strong performance is particularly true during a Bearish Season, where we can achieve 13% returns with a small drawdown of only 5%.

	Contrary our initial intuition, the combined strategy performs poorly after running a backtest. Despite trading during the top-performing sessions of both seasons, we don't see nearly the level of performance we would have expected, and it underperforms trading just the Night Session. The likely reason is that the Afternoon Session and Close Session underperform their theoretical results and thus drag down the combined performance.

	For further study, we could consider a more delicate rule for stop loss/profit instead of just trading at a specific time on every trading day and consider implementing other risk-management strategies.
