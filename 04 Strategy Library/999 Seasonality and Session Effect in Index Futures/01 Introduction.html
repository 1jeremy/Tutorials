	In this research, we investigate the Seasonality and Market Session effect in the E-Mini S&P 500 futures. A recent article, Market Seasonality Study
, argues that there is a seasonality effect in the futures market, specifically relating to E-Mini S&P 500 futures. The study argues that it's trading strategy implemented in the period from November to May lends itself to a bull market (Bullish Season), while the trading days between June and October (Bearish Season) hold far less profit. 

	As for Session effect, another article, Seasonality S&P Market Session
, shows that, after splitting each trading day into 8 basic sessions, the Night Session (18:00 - 5:30) provides a much greater profit for a single contract of the E-mini S&P 500 futures, compared to other sessions, both on Bullish Season and Bearish Season. Additionally, the Afternoon Session (12:15 - 14:00) and the Close Session (14:00 - 15:15) perform well in the Bullish Season too, and so does the Afternoon Session (12:15 - 14:00) in the Bearish Season. Therefore, it is natural to come up with a combined strategy which aggregates the top three profitable bullish and the top two profitable bearish strategies to see if we can maximize the returns.
