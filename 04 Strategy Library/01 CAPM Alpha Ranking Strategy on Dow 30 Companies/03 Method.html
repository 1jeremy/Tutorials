	Our investment logic is simple and straightforward. We assume that stocks which beat the market last month will continue to beat the market. We rank stocks according to their alpha, and each month we "long" the top two stocks. For this strategy to work, we need to do the following at the start of each month:
</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Get the historical price of Dow 30 stocks in the past 21 trading days and calculate their daily rates of return.</li>
 	<li>Conduct simple linear regression on the return of each stock against a benchmark (S&amp;P 500 index, SPY).</li>
 	<li>Rank the stocks by their intercepts.</li>
 	<li>Liquidate all our positions and purchase the first 2 stocks in our sorted list.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Dow Jones components change very infrequently, with the last change being on March 19th, 2015 [ref]<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average</a></strong>[/ref]. To make the implementation easier we have simply listed the current Dow components in this algorithm. This means that the earliest start date of this algorithm is March 19th, 2015.

<h3>Step 1: Setup Event Handler</h3>
<p>
	In the initialize method we define a Scheduled Event to trigger a monthly re-balancing of the portfolio. For more details about how to use Scheduled Events, you can read the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs#Scheduled-Events">Documentation</a> or see the example <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.Python/ScheduledEventsAlgorithm.py">ScheduledEventsAlgorithm</a>.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">def Initialize(self):
    self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.MonthStart(self.benchmark), self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen(self.benchmark), Action(self.rebalance))
	</pre>
	</div>

<h3>Step 2: Linear Regression Function</h3>
<p>
	In order to conduct linear regression, we need to write a function to take the price data and output the regression results. The function takes a list of the "asset prices" (x) and a list of the "benchmark prices" (y). It then calculates the percentage change and conducts a linear regression. The output is a tuple which contains the intercept and slope.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">def regression(self,x,y):
    x = np.array(x)
    x = np.diff(x)/x[:-1]
    y = np.array(y)
    y = np.diff(y)/y[:-1]
    A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
    result = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y)[0]
    beta = result[0]
    alpha = result[1]
    return(alpha,beta)
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Step 3: History Function</h3>
<p>
	Each month we get the historical prices of the DOW30 components using the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic182.html">History</a> API. The data is returned from the API as complex <em>Slice</em> objects. To make this useful in the algorithm we extract the asset prices, and benchmark prices to a list.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">def get_regression_data(self,symbol,history):
    symbol_price = []
    benchmark_price = []
    for i in history:
        bar = i[symbol]
        benchmark = i[self.benchmark]
        symbol_price.append(bar.Close)
        benchmark_price.append(benchmark.Close)

    result = self.regression(symbol_price,benchmark_price)
    return result
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Step 4: Rebalance Function:</h3>
<p>
	This function is where all the action happens, it will be executed on the first trading day of each month as a scheduled event. The second argument of SetHoldings is a decimal, setting this to "1" tells the algorithm to set the portfolio as "long 100%" with no leverage. More information on the function can be read on this link: <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs#Trading-and-Orders">SetHoldings</a>.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">def rebalance(self):
    # get historical stock symbols and prices, then put them in tuples
    history = self.History(self.regression_dates, Resolution.Daily)
    filter = []
    for i in self.symbols:
        filter.append((i,self.get_regression_data(i, history)[0]))
    # sort the filter by alpha
    filter.sort(key = lambda x : x[1],reverse = True)
    sorted_symbols = []
    for i in range(2):
    	sorted_symbols.append(filter[i][0])
    # get the symbols of our holding stocks
    holding_list = []
    for i in self.Portfolio:
    	if i.Value.Invested:
    		holding_list.append(i.Value.Symbol)
    # if we have holdings and we are not going to hold them anymore, sell them
    if holding_list:
    	for i in holding_list:
    		if i not in sorted_symbols:
    			self.Liquidate(i)
    # Long the 2 stock in our list.
    for i in sorted_symbols:
    	self.SetHoldings(i,1)
		</pre>
