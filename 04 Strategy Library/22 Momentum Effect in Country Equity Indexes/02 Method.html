  The algorithm 35 counrty indices ETFs as the trading universe. As the universe doesn't change over time. We use the momentum indicator helper method
  <code>self.MOM(symbol, period, resolution)</code>. This helper method creates a new momentum indicator and computes the absolute n-period change in
  the security. In contracst to the indicator constructor <code>Momentum(period)</code>, the helper method indocator will be automatically updated on
  the given resolution.

  In <code>Initialize()</code>, we set the warm up period to the momentum period and create the dictionary <code>self.data</code> to save the indicator of
  each symbol. Each month, the top five indices ETFs with the best 6-month momentum will be selected to open long position. ETFs which is no longer in
  this top list will be liquidated. This shceduled event API is used to schedule the portfolio rebalance at the start of each month.
