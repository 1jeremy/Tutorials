    Since we trade three technology stocks, we decided to use QQQ as our benchmark. We achieve a Sharpe Ratio of 1.028 over
    two years, while QQQ achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 0.931 over the same period. However, it should be noted that since the
    algorithm is non-deterministic, users may see different results from repeated backtests.
