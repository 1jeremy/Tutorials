  We conclude that the momentum pattern documented by Gao et al (2017) produces lower returns over our testing period.
  In the algorithm attached above, we find a compounding annual return of -3.8%. This may be attributed to the 
  inclusion of transaction costs in our analysis while Gao et al (2017) decide to ignore them. Throughout their 
  research paper, Gao et al (2017) provide several suggestions to increase the return generated by this momentum 
  pattern. These areas of future research include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Trading only on days with economic news events by utilizing the 
    <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alternative-data/trading-economics">TradingEconomics</a> data set. 
    Gae et al (2017) suggest using the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, and news released on gross domestic 
    product or the consumer price index.
  </li>
  <li>Restricting trading to times of greater volatility or during financial crises.</li>
  <li>Incorporating a volume threshold the morning session must pass to signal a trade for the close.</li>
  <li>Increasing diversification by extending the universe to include ETFs from other sectors.</li>
  <li>
    Considering the return from multiple n-minute periods throughout the day to predict the return of the closing 
    period.
