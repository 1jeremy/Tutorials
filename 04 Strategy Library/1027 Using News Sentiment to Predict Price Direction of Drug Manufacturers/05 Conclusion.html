  We conclude that deploying the sentiment analysis strategy on the US drug manufacturer industry does not provide 
  as accurate results as found by Isah et al (2018). The algorithm above achieves a win rate of 47%. However, with 
  a 1.16 profit-loss ratio, it remains profitable throughout the 2020 stock market crash. Only after restricting 
  trading to the most profitable day of the week (Berument & Kiymaz, 2001) does the strategy achieve profitability 
  over this testing period. We attribute the decrease in performance to the commissions and spread costs simulated 
  by LEAN.

To continue the development of this strategy, future areas of research include:

<ul>
  <li>Adding a threshold parameter the cumulative sentiment counter must pass to signal trades</li>
  <li>
    Only analyzing the sentiment of articles which contain keywords like "US, "USA", 'Q1', and others in their 
    titles
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/stemming-lemmatization-python">Stemming</a> and removing 
    punctuation from articles before calculating their sentiment
  </li>
  <li>Adding phrases to the sentiment dictionary or adjust the sentiment values</li>
  <li>Adding other data feeds beside just Tiingo</li>
</ul>
