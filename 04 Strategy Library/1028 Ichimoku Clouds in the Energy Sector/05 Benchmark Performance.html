  To analyze the performance of this trading strategy, we compare its return to the return of buying and holding a 
  popular ETF tracking the energy sector. In this study, we use XLE, the Energy Select Sector SPDRÂ® Fund, as the 
  benchmark. We can see from the plot below that holding the benchmark ETF would have produced a return of -32% over
  the backtest period.
