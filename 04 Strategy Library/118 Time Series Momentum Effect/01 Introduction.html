Time series momentum is related to, but different from the phenomenon known as “momentum” in the finance literature, which is primarily cross-sectional in nature.
The momentum literature focuses on the relative performance of securities in the cross section, finding that securities that recently outperformed their peers over the past 3 to 12 months continue to outperform their peers on average over the next month. 
Therefore, the usual strategy is to sort the returns of all the assets and choose the top ones to invest.
Rather than focus on the relative returns of securities in the cross section, time series momentum focuses purely on a security’s own past return.
Every month, the investor considers whether the excess return of each asset over the past 12 months is positive or negative and goes long on the contract if it is positive and short if negative. 
The position size is set to be inversely proportional to the their volatility. 
A univariate <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalalizedautogregressiveconditionalheteroskedasticity.asp">GARCH</a> model could be used to estimate volatility. 
However, other simple models could probably be easily used with good results (for example, the easiest one would be using historical volatility). 
The portfolio is rebalanced monthly. For the sake of simplicity, we use hitorical volatility to estimate volatility.
