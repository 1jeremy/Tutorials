  <code>TradingCalendar</code> class can help us find all the available holidays during a period of time.
  <code>GetDaysByType</code> returns trading days of the specified <code>TradingDayType</code> that contains trading events associated with the range of dates.
  Here we choose the type to be <code>PublicHoliday</code> and list all holidays from today to the next two days.
</P>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
def OnData(self, data):
    calendar = self.TradingCalendar.GetDaysByType(TradingDayType.PublicHoliday, self.Time, self.Time+timedelta(days=2))
    holidays = [i.Date for i in calendar]
</pre>

  The investment vehicle is SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF. The algorithm will trade the ETF if there are holidays within the next two days and stays in cash during other trading days.
