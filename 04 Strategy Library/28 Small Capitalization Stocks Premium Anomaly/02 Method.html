  The first step is coarse universe selection. We create an investment universe with stocks that have fundmental data and with a price greater than $5.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">return [x.Symbol for x in coarse if x.HasFundamentalData and x.Price > 5]
</pre>
</div>
<p>In fine universe selection, we sort the stocks in the universe by the market capitalization and choose 10 stocks with the lowest market cap.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">def FineSelectionFunction(self, fine):
    if self.year == self.Time.year:
        return self.symbols

    # Calculate the market cap and add the "MarketCap" property to fine universe object
    for i in fine:
        i.MarketCap = (i.EarningReports.BasicAverageShares.ThreeMonths * 
                       i.EarningReports.BasicEPS.TwelveMonths *
                       i.ValuationRatios.PERatio)

    sorted_market_cap = sorted([x for x in fine if x.MarketCap > 0], key=lambda x: x.MarketCap)

    self.symbols = [i.Symbol for i in sorted_market_cap[:10]]
    return self.symbols
</pre>
</div>
<p>
   In <code>OnData()</code>, we buy 10 stocks in the list of lowest market-cap. The portfolio is rebalanced every year.
