  In this tutorial we implement a high frequency and dynamic pairs trading strategy based on market-neutral statistical arbitrage strategy using a two-stage correlation and cointegration approach. This strategy is based on George J. Miao's work.[ref]<strong>George J. Miao </strong>High Frequency and Dynamic Pairs Trading Based on Statistical Arbitrage Using a Two-Stage Correlation and Cointegration Approach <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX9qHlqt7UAhVBOj4KHX-IAU4QFggkMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccsenet.org%2Fjournal%2Findex.php%2Fijef%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F33007%2F19708&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbUXJRGML636l1kKu_sEGoI4SZcQ"><strong>Online Copy</strong></a>[/ref]We applied this trading strategy to the U.S. bank sector stocks, backtested this strategy with 10-minute stock data from 2012 to 2013. Our trading strategy yields a compounding annual return up to 29.4% and a 0.968 sharpe ratio.

  This strategy is especially profitable when the market is performing poorly. The profit is resulted from mispricing, and mispricings are likely to happen when the market goes down or volatility increases.

  To explore this strategy further, we design this strategy to be flexible. We can change the data resolution into 5 minutes, 10 minutes or even 30 minutes by simply changing a parameter. It's also essential to choose optimized entering, closing and stop loss threshold. Everyone can has his/her own version of this strategy.
