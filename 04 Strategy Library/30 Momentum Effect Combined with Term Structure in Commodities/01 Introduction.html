  In the last two tutorials, we discussed the momentum anomaly and the term structure effect of commodity futures.
  Term structure strategy selects contracts in deep contango and backwardation based on the roll return and the momentum strategy goes long past winners and short past losers based on the historical return.
  This algorithm will combine both effects to exploit the trading signals in commodity futures.
