  In the last two tutorials, we discussed the momentum anomaly and the term structure effect of commodity futures.
  Term structure strategy selects contracts in deep contango and backwardation. In other words, the portfolio is created by buying each month the 20% of commodities with the highest roll-returns and shorts the 20% of commodities with the lowest roll-returns and holds the long-short positions for one month.
  The momentum strategy goes long commodity futures with the highest one-month momentum and shorts on futures with the lowest one-month momentum. Signals are based on the historical return.
  This algorithm will combine both effects to exploit the trading signals in commodity futures.
