    Several methods have been developed to forecast time-series, from ARIMA to Neural Networks. In this strategy, we
    combine a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Wavelets in an attempt to forecast EURJPY. Although SVMs are most often
    used for classification problems, such as classifying proteins, they can also be applied in regression problems, and
    are able to handle non-linear data. Wavelets are often applied in Signal Processing applications, and they can be
    used to decompose a time-series into multiple components, and each component can be denoised using thresholding, so
    when they are recombined, the original time-series becomes cleaner. We can combine these models by applying SVMs to
    forecast the individual components of a time-series decomposed by Wavelets, and recombine them for an aggregate
    forecast, which we detail in the <em>Method</em> section.
