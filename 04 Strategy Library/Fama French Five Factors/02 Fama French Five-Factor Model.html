    The Fama French five-factor model was proposed in 2014 and is adapted from the Fama French three-factor model (Fama and French, 2015). It builds upon the dividend discount model which states that the value of stocks today is dependent upon future dividends.
    Fama and French add two factors, investment and profitability, to the dividend discount model to better capture the relationship between risk and return.
    The model is as follows
</p>
\[ R = \alpha + \beta_m MKT + \beta_s SMB + \beta_h HML + \beta_r RMW + \beta_c CMA\]

<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
    <li>MKT is the excess return of the market. It is the return on the value-weighted market portfolio.</li>
    <li>SMB is the return on a diversified portfolio of small-cap stocks minus the return on a diversified portfolio of big-cap stocks.</li>
    <li>HML is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of stocks with high and low Book-to-Market ratios.</li>
    <li>RMW is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of stocks with robust (high and steady) and weak (low) profitability.</li>
    <li>CMA is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of the stocks of low and high investment firms, which we call conservative and aggressive. Here, low/high investment means reinvestment ratio is low/high.</li>
</ul>
