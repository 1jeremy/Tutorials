<p>
BootCamp is divided into <i>Courses</i>, <i>Lessons</i> and <i>Tasks</i>.  A <i>Course</i> groups together a super-category and is currently organized by asset-class. 
  A <i>Lesson</i> focuses on the implementation of a single algorithm. 
  A <i>Task</i> breaks up the algorithm implementing into tiny steps easily implemented, aiming to guide the user through the coding process.
