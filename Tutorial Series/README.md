# QuantConnect Tutorials

Current we have two tutorial series: Introduction to Financial Python and Introduction to Options. We made them open-source on github and published them on WordPress. 

## Introduction to Financial Python
This tutorial series starts from basic Python and finance concepts. If you have great investment ideas but don’t know how to build, or you think you need to learn some basic skills in quantitative finance, here is a good start point. These series include four parts: Python, basic math and statistics, basic finance regarding investment, and financial time series analysis, which is an advanced curriculum in quantitative finance.

We not only introduce the concepts but also show you how to apply the introduced technique step by step using Python code snippets. We use real financial datasets as examples, and show you what those charts in text book look like with real-world financial data. After each chapter, we also design a QC algorithm applying what we learned. We do this in order to let you have a more comprehensive understanding and see the differences between the theories and the practice — sometimes it can be hard to apply a simple concept.
